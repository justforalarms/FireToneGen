# FireToneGen
A simple monophonic tone generator written for the Arduino framework.

# Disclaimer
***This is not supposed to be used with existing code. The point of this project is to have a dedicated seperate "processor" for tone generation, as inefficient as that may be.***   
   
You need one ATmega328(p) and another processor that has **hardware I2C** support, and has support for the Arduino framework in PlatformIO.
